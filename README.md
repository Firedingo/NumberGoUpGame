# NumberGoUpGame

This is a Gamemaker Studio 2 project. The code is written in GML or Gamemaker Language. The purpose is to make a number go up. As basic as it is, it has met the requirement for its creation. This was written up on a day when my brain wasn't so happy or well and the black dog was barking loudly. As such, this game is functioning but incredibly barebones.

You are free to do whatever you would like with this game. Some credit is appreciated though.
At some point this game may get some polish to make it better.
